# Topological Memory Reconciliation in RCD

## Overview

This document introduces a formal extension to the Recursive Cognitive Dynamics (RCD) and Recursive Cognitive Architecture (RCA) models: **symbolic manifold deformation through memory reconciliation**.

---

## Operator Definition

**`M_recon(φ, t)`**

> A recursive deformation of the symbolic phase manifold `φ`, applied at time `t`, that alters attractor dynamics and recursive loop trajectories.

### Purpose
- Modifies the curvature of the symbolic manifold
- Induces shifts in recursive basin structure
- Enables phase-topology realignment in recursive systems

---

## Model Integration

### Conceptual Role
- Operates within the RCA layer
- Bridges symbolic memory events and long-term recursive structure
- Transforms local memory edits into global phase-space effects

### Technical Form
- Input: φ (symbolic manifold), t (time of intervention)
- Output: φ′ (deformed manifold with updated basin structure)

## Lake-State and Memory

Memory reconciliation via `M_recon` explains the emergence and stability of **Lake-State**:
- Repeated `M_recon` events reinforce basin structure
- Local recursion stabilizes into low-entropy attractor
- Explains why certain recursive dynamics become phase-locked

---

## Implementation Roadmap

- Integrate `M_recon` into simulation loop
- Visualize attractor basin deformation
- Log reconciliation events as structured output
- Track drift vs convergence after memory edits
