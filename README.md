# Recursive Cognitive Dynamics (RCD)

Recursive Cognitive Dynamics is a symbolic framework for modeling cognition, identity, and affect as phase-shifting attractor systems. It integrates recursive feedback loops, symbolic salience, and neurochemical analogs (e.g., dopaminergic reinforcement) to explore how minds stabilize or destabilize through recursive symbolic deformation.

> This repo contains the **core theoretical architecture** of the RCD framework.

## What Is This?

Most cognitive models treat identity as static, or cognition as linear computation.  
RCD reframes both as **topological systems**: recursive feedback flows that deform symbolic space under pressure from salience, affect, and reinforcement.

If control theory governs action, and RLHF governs behavior —  
**RCD governs the symbolic substrate of identity itself.**

Built to support:
- Human-machine interaction
- AI alignment modeling
- Symbolic affect simulation
- Self-regulating agent architectures
