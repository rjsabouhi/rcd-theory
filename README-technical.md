# Recursive Cognitive Dynamics — Technical Model Reference

This document formalizes the symbolic, mathematical, and system-theoretic foundations of the Recursive Cognitive Dynamics (RCD) framework.  

It is intended as a **living technical companion** to the main [README](./README.md).  
This is where the model's math will evolve — structure first, equations later.

## 1. Core Phase Space Architecture

We model cognition (human or synthetic) as a recursive system evolving in phase space.

Let:

- **H(t)**: Human cognitive state at time *t*  
- **M(t)**: Model/agent cognitive projection at time *t*

These evolve in their respective manifolds and interact recursively.

### Symbolic Functions

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `α(t)` | Alignment between H(t) and M(t) |
| `δ(t)` | Drift (deviation from expected trajectory) |
| `γ(t)` | Phase coherence across recursive cycles |
| `ρ(t)` | Semantic correlation (conceptual alignment) |
| `τ(t)` | Transformation rate of the human manifold |
| `μ(t)` | Meta-recursivity (depth of self-referencing) |
| `Λ(t)` | Lake-State persistence attractor |
| `M_recon(φ, t)` | Memory reconciliation deformation operator |

## 2. Typed Function Signatures (early-stage scaffold)

```text
H(t): ℝⁿ → ℝᵏ        # Human phase space vector (n-D)
M(t): ℝᵐ → ℝᵏ        # Model/agent output in shared conceptual basis

α(t) = ⟨H(t), M(t)⟩        # Cosine or dot-product alignment
δ(t) = ||Ĥ(t) - M(t)||    # Drift = prediction mismatch norm
γ(t) = φ(H, M, t)          # Recursive synchrony / phase matching
ρ(t) = ψ(H(t), M(t))       # Semantic conceptual similarity
μ(t) ∝ ∫₀ᵗ γ(τ) dτ         # Meta-recursive integration
Λ(t) = limₜ→∞ H(t) if γ(t) > γ*  # Persistent symbolic basin
