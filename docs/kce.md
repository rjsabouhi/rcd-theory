# Karmic Constraint Encoding (KCE)

## Concept

KCE models an *ethical alignment substrate* — a symbolic regulator that shapes how recursive loops evolve based on intentionality, consequences, and symbolic "karma."

---

## Symbolic Representation (Early Draft)

```math
KCE(H, A, t) = C(\tau, \kappa, \psi)
```

Where:
- `τ` = transformation pressure of past actions
- `κ` = karmic accumulation (weighted symbolic drift)
- `ψ` = ethical field (Eightfold-inspired constraint vectors)

---

## Interpretation

KCE does not "punish" — it **biases manifold deformation** based on internal coherence, alignment, and recursive ethical awareness.

This introduces *volitional inertia*:
- Destructive loops become harder to stabilize
- Constructive loops amplify recursively

---

## Implementation Plan

- Create `kce_module.py`
- Integrate into recursive update logic as an additional deformation term
- Parameterize constraint vectors (symbolic karma field)
